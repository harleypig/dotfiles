Possibly convert things setup and run from .bashrc into a separate file for each application or function it's used for.

Something like

.bashrc.d
  git - contains functions and aliases and such used for git
  prompt - contains functions and aliases and such used for the prompt
  etc...

Modify symlink.sh to accept parameter which reads a file containing a list of symlinks to create:

symlink.sh harleypig.com
symlink.sh work.desk

instead of copying all dotfiles blindly.

try using rsync instead:
