Help me clean up and optimize my bash setup in a 'dotfiles' repository by
organizing files, minimizing memory usage and startup time, and creating
documentation and tests. The setup includes a 'shell_startup' file linked to
.bashrc, .bash_profile, and .profile, as well as aliases and bash completions in
the environment. Most functions should be executables, with a few exceptions.
The organization should include 'rcs', 'bin', 'tests', and 'docs' directories.
The documentation should be in markdown format as a Vimwiki, with some parts
generated from file documentation. Use the BATS testing framework for tests, and
set up continuous integration with GitHub for automated testing and linting
across different versions of bash and Linux distributions. Assist in creating a
plan or roadmap for addressing each part of the cleanup and optimization
process.
