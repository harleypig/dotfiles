Convert Bash Libraries and Functions to Individual Files

Discussion Points:
- Identify which bash libraries and functions are suitable for conversion to individual files.
- Determine the criteria for splitting up complex libraries into simpler, standalone scripts.
- Consider how separating these elements can improve maintainability and reduce memory usage by only loading necessary functions.
- Plan the structure of the bin directory to accommodate these new individual script files.
- Assess the impact on existing scripts and environments that source the current bash libraries.
