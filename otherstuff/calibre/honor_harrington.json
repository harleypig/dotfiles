    "comments": "<p><strong>A NEW SERIES SET IN THE \"HONORVERSE\" OF HONOR HARRINGTON</strong>  </p>\n<p>The Star Kingdom's ally Erewhon is growing increasingly restive in the alliance because the new High Ridge regime ignores its needs. Added to the longstanding problem of a slave labor planet controlled by hostile Mesans in Erewhon's stellar backyard, which High Ridge refuses to deal with, the recent assassination of the Solarian League's most prominent voice of public conscience indicates the growing danger of political instability in the Solarian League\u2014which is also close to Erewhon.  </p>\n<p>In desperation, Queen Elizabeth tries to defuse the situation by sending a private mission to Erewhon led by Captain Zilwicki, accompanied by one of her nieces. When they arrive on Erewhon, however, Manticore's envoys find themselves in a mess. Not only do they encounter one of the Republic of Haven's most capable agents\u2014Victor Cachat\u2014but they also discover that the Solarian League's military delegation seems up to its neck in skullduggery.  </p>\n<p>And, just to put the icing on the cake, the radical freed slave organization, the Audubon Ballroom, is also on the scene\u2014led by its notorious and ruthless assassin, Jeremy X.  </p>\n<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).  </p>\n<p>With over seven million copies of his books in print and seventeen titles on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, <strong>David Weber</strong> is the science fiction publishing phenomenon of the new millennium. In the hugely popular Honor Harrington series, the spirit of C.S. Forester\u2019s Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O\u2019Brian\u2019s Master and Commander lives on\u2013into the galactic future. Books in the Honor Harrington series have appeared on seventeen best seller lists, including those of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> , <em>The New York Times</em> , and <em>USA Today</em>. While Weber is best known for his spirited, modern\u2011minded space operas, he is also the creator of the Oath of Swords fantasy series and the Dahak science fiction saga. Weber has also engaged in a steady stream of bestselling collaborations, including his Starfire series with Steve White, which produced the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Shiva Option</em> among others. Weber\u2019s collaboration with alternate history master Eric Flint led to the bestselling <em>1634: The Baltic War</em> , and his planetary adventure novels with military science fiction ace and multiple national best\u2011seller John Ringo includes the blockbusters <em>March to the Stars</em> and <em>We Few</em>.\u00a0Finally, Weber\u2019s teaming with Linda Evans produced the bestselling Multiverse series. David Weber makes his home in South Carolina with his wife and children.  </p>\n<p><strong>Eric Flint</strong> is a new master of science fiction. His alternate-history novel <em>1632</em> received lavish critical praise from all directions and enjoyed high sales. The sequel, <em>1633</em> , written in collaboration with David Weber, has also been highly praised and popular. His first novel, <em>Mother of Demons</em> , was picked by <em>Science Fiction Chronicle</em> as a best novel of the year. He has also shown a powerful gift for humorous fantasy adventure with <em>Forward the Mage</em> and <em>The Philosophical Strangler</em> , which <em>Booklist</em> described as \"Monty Python let loose in Tolkien's Middle Earth.\" With David Drake he has collaborated on five novels in the popular \"Belisarius\" series, and is working on the sixth, <em>The Dance of Time</em>. A longtime labor union activist with a master's degree in history, he currently resides in Indiana with his wife Lucille.\n**</p>",

Now the conspiracy stands exposed by spies Anton Zilwicki and Victor Cachat\u2014one an agent of Honor Harrington\u2019s Star Kingdom of Manticore, the other a Havenite operative. The outing of the Alignment has turned the galaxy\u2019s political framework topsy-turvy. Old coalitions have disintegrated. New alliances have been born.  </p><p>For starters, the long and hard-fought war between the Republic of Haven and the Star Empire of Manticore is not only over, but these bitter enemies have formed a new pact. Their common foe: the Mesan Alignment itself.   </p><p>But more information is needed to bring the Alignment out of the shadows. Now, defying the odds and relying on genetic wizardry themselves for a disguise, Zilwicki and Cachat return to Mesa\u2014only to discover that even they have underestimated the Alignment\u2019s ruthlessness and savagery.   </p><p>Soon they are on the run in Mesa\u2019s underworld, not only hunted by the Alignment but threatened by the exploding conflict on the planet between Mesa\u2019s overlords and the brutalized slaves and descendants of slaves who have suffered under their rule for so long. But if Zilwicki and Cachat succeed in rooting out the ancient conspiracy, a great evil may be finally removed from the galaxy\u2014and on a long-oppressed planet, freedom may finally dawn.  </p><p><strong>About the Crown of Slave Series:</strong><br>\"Fans of Weber's Honor Harrington series \u2026 will be delighted with this offshoot in which he and coauthor Flint develop several situations and characters from other stories. ...This outstanding effort transcends the label 'space opera' and truly is a novel of ideas.\u201d\u2014<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>**</p></div>",

That's why the Kingdom of Manticore needs allies against the so-called \"\"Republic\"\" of Haven--and the planet Grayson is just the right strategic place to make a very good ally indeed. But Her Majesty's Foreign Office had overlooked a \"\"minor cultural difference\"\" when they chose Honor Harrington to carry the flag: women on the planet Grayson are without rank or rights; Honor's very presence is an intolerable affront to every male on the planet.  </p>\n<p>At first Honor doesn't take it personally; where she comes from gender discrimination is barely a historical memory, right up there in significance to fear of the left-handed. But in time such treatment as she receives from the Graysonites does become wearing, and Honor would withdraw if she could--but then Grayson's fratricidal sister planet attacks without warning and she must stay and prevail, not just for Honor's honor, but for her sovereign's, for--THE HONOR OF THE QUEEN.  </p>\n<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).\n**</p>",

She's been shot at, shot down, and just plain shot, had starships blown out from under her, and made personal enemies who will stop at nothing to ruin her, and somehow she's survived it all.  </p>\n<p>But this time she's really in trouble.  </p>\n<p>The People's Republic of Haven has finally found an admiral who can win battles, and Honor's orders take her straight into an ambush. Outnumbered, outgunned, and unable to run, she has just two options: see the people under her command die in a hopeless, futile battle... or surrender them-and herself-to the Peeps.  </p>\n<p>There can be only one choice, and at least the People's Navy promises to treat their prisoners honorably. But the Navy is overruled by the political authorities, and Honor finds herself bound for a prison planet aptly named \"Hell\"... and her scheduled execution.  </p>\n<p>Put into solitary confinement, separated from her officers and her treecat Nimitz, and subjected to systematic humiliation by her gaolers, Honor's future has become both bleak and short. Yet bad as things look, they're about to get worse ...for the Peeps.  </p>\n<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).  </p>\n<p>A lifetime military history buff, David Weber has carried his interest in history into his fiction.\u00a0 In the <em>New York Times</em> best selling Honor Harrington series, the spirit of both C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower and history's Admiral Nelson are evident.\u00a0 With over five million copies of his books in print, David Weber is the fastest rising star in the Science Fiction universe.\u00a0 His Honor Harrington series boasts over 3 million copies in print, and Weber has had over thirteen of his titles on <em>The New York Times</em> Best Seller List.\u00a0 <em>War of Honor</em> , book 10 in the series appeared on over twelve Best Seller lists, including <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> , <em>The New York Times</em> , and <em>USA TODAY</em>.  </p>\n<p>While he is best known for his spirited, modern-minded space operas, he has also developed a fantasy series, of which two books have been published:\u00a0 <em>Oath of Swords</em> and <em>The War God's Own</em>. \u00a0David's solo work also includes three novels of the \"Dahak\" series, and the stand alone novels:\u00a0 <em>Path of the Fury</em> and <em>The Excalibur Alternative</em>.  </p>\n<p>Weber's first published novels grew out of his work as a war game designer for the Task Force game Starfire.\u00a0 With collaborator Steve White, Weber has written four novels set in that universe: <em>Insurrection</em> , <em>Crusade</em> , <em>In Death Ground</em> , and <em>The Shiva Option</em>.  </p>\n<p>Recent bestsellers in planetary adventures also include the teamwork of John Ringo in the best selling Empire of Man series where the titles <em>March Upcountry</em> , <em>March to the Sea</em> , <em>March to the Stars</em> and <em>We Few</em> have made appearances on <em>The New York Times</em> List.  </p>\n<p>Weber's proliferation continues with author Eric Flint, where they joined forces in the Best Selling \"Ring of Fire\" alternate history series, for <em>1634: The Baltic War</em> , coming in May.  </p>\n<p>A popular guest at science fiction conventions, Weber makes his home in South Carolina with his wife Sharon, three children and a passel of dogs.\n**</p>",

Yet their military is over-extended and the People's Republic is poised to take (he offensive once more, this time with a new strategy, new weapons, a new command team, and a whole new determination to win. The war is about to enter a phase of unprecedented ferocity . . . and the Alliance is on the short end of the stick.  </p>\n<p>But even as powerful Peep fleets hurtle towards their objectives, neither they nor the Alliance are aware of events occurring on a distant, isolated, inescapable prison planet called Hell. For what no one knows, not even State Security, is that Honor Harrington is not dead.

David Weber, the master of spaceways adventure, is back, so get ready for bigger sales than ever!What price victory? The war with the Republic of Haven has resumed . . . disastrously for the Star Kingdom of Manticore. Admiral Lady Dame Honor Harrington, Steadholder and Duchess Harrington, the single victorious Allied commander of the opening phase of the new war, has been recalled from the Sidemore System to command Eighth Fleet. Everyone knows Eighth Fleet is the Alliance's primary offensive command, which makes it the natural assignment for the woman the media calls \"the Salamander.\" But what most of the public DOESN'T know is that not only are the Star Kingdom and its Allies badly outnumbered by the Republic's new fleet, but that the odds are going to get steadily worse. Eighth Fleet's job is to somehow prevent those odds from crushing the Alliance before the Star Kingdom can regain its strategic balance. It's a job which won't be done cheaply. Honor Harrington must meet her formidable responsibilities with inferior forces even as she copes with tumultuous changes in her personal and public life. The alternative to victory is total defeat, yet this time the COST of victory will be agonizingly high.",

Not even its own government knows how enormous its economy truly is. And for hundreds of years, the League has borne the banner of human civilization, been the ideal to which humanity aspires in its diaspora across the galaxy.  </p>\n<p>But the bureaucrats known as the \"Mandarins,\" who rule today's League, are not the men and women who founded it so long ago. They are corrupt, venal, accountable to no one . . . and they've decided the upstart Star Kingdom of Manticore must be destroyed.  </p>\n<p>Honor Harrington has worn the Star Kingdom's uniform for half a century and served her monarch and her people well. In the course of those years, the woman the newsies call the Salamander has grown from a tactically brilliant but politically na\u00efve junior officer to supreme fleet command and a seat on the highest military and political councils of the Grand Alliance.  </p>\n<p>Very few people know war the way Honor Harrington does. Very few have lost as many men and women, as many friends, as much family, as she has. Yet despite that, hers has been a voice of caution. She knows the Mandarins and the Solarian League Navy are growing increasingly desperate as the truth of their technological inferiority sinks home, but she also knows the sheer size of the League. And she knows how its citizens will react if the Grand Alliance takes the war to the League, attacks its star systems, destroys its infrastructure . . . kills its civilians. Today's victory, bought on those terms, can only guarantee a future war of revenge against a resurgent Solarian League and its navy.  </p>\n<p>Honor knows the Grand Alliance must find a victory that doesn't require incursions deep into Solarian space, doesn't leave a legacy of bottomless hatred, and the strategy she supports has been working.  </p>\n<p>The League is sliding towards inglorious defeat as it steadily loses ground in the Protectorates and the Verge. As its central government teeters towards bankruptcy and even some of its core systems opt to secede in the face of the Mandarins' corruption. As the Solarian Navy finally realizes it cannot face an Alliance battle fleet and win.  </p>\n<p>But the Mandarins have embraced a desperate new strategy, and in pursuit of that strategy, the SLN has committed atrocities such as the galaxy has not known in a thousand years. The League have violated its own Eridani Edict against mass civilian casualties, violated the Deneb Accords prohibition on war crimes.  </p>\n<p>And they have finally killed too many of the people Honor Harrington loves.  </p>\n<p>Hers is the voice of caution and compromise no longer, and the galaxy is about to see something it has never imagined.  </p>\n<p>The Salamander is coming for the Solarian League, and Hell is coming in her wake.  </p>\n<p><strong>About <em>Uncompromising Honor</em>:</strong><br>\n\u201c\u2026a balanced mix of interstellar intrigue,\u00a0counterespionage, and epic fleet action\u2026with all the hard- and software details and tactical proficiency that Weber delivers like no one else; along with a large cast of well-developed, believable characters, giving each clash of fleets emotional weight.\u201d<em>\u2014Booklist</em>  </p>\n<p>\u201c. . . moves. . . as inexorably as the Star Kingdom\u2019s Grand Fleet, commanded by series protagonist Honor Harrington. . . .

    "comments": "David Weber has shot to the forefront of science fiction. The core of his work is Honor Harrington, the toughest, smartest starship captain in the galaxy. David Weber himself is on board with two never-before-published excursions into Honor's universe. First, he tells how young Honor Harrington first demonstrated the heroic stuff she was made of when she and her treecat Nimitz face the impossible task of rescuing the victims of an avalanche in a sub-zero blizzard. Weber returns with a chapter in the history of the telepathic treecats, who are far more intelligent than humans realize, and with whom the right human can form a close telepathic bond that can be severed only by death. But in this case, the young human who bonded with a treecat was a Very Important Person. Specifically, she was the Manticoran crown princess and heir to the throne of the empire. Roland Green, author of the 'Starcruiser Shenandoah' series and the 'Peace Company' series, is on board with a hard-hitting account of what happened when Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven went eyeball-to-eyeball over a strategically vital planet.",

Book #2 in the Manticore Ascendant series, set in\u00a0David Weber's Honorverse. This year\u00a0we celebrate\u00a0the 25th anniversary of Honor Harrington.  </p>\n<p>Lieutenant Travis Long of the Royal Manticoran Navy is the sort of person who likes an orderly universe. One where people follow the rules.  </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he lives in the\u00a0<em>real\u00a0</em>universe.  </p>\n<p>The good news is that Travis is one of those rare people who may\u00a0<em>like</em>\u00a0rules but has a talent for thinking outside them when everything starts coming apart. That talent has stood him\u2014and the Star Kingdom\u2014in good stead in the past, and it\u2019s one reason he\u2019s now a \u201cmustang,\u201d an ex-enlisted man who\u2019s been given a commission as a King\u2019s officer.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>The bad news is that two of the best ways of making enemies ever invented are insisting on enforcing the rules . . . and thinking outside them when other people don\u2019t. But the one rule Travis Long absolutely can\u2019t break is the one that says an officer in the Royal Navy does his duty, whatever the consequences.  </p>\n<p>At the moment, there are powerful forces in the young Star Kingdom of Manticore\u2019s Parliament which don\u2019t think they need him. For that matter, they\u2019re pretty sure they don\u2019t need the Royal Manticoran Navy, either. After all, what does a sleepy little single-system star nation on the outer edge of the explored galaxy need with a\u00a0<em>navy?</em>  </p>\n<p>Unhappily for them, the edge of the explored galaxy can be a far more dangerous place than they think it is. They\u2019re about to find out why they need the Navy . . . and how very, very fortunate they are that Travis Long is in it.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>About <em>A Call to Arms</em>:</strong><br>\n\u201cThe plotting is as solid as ever, with smaller scenes building to an explosive, action-packed crescendo, and the authors strike a nice balance between technical details of space flight and the human cost of war.\"\u2014<em>Publishers Weekly</em>  </p>\n<p><strong>Praise for prequel\u00a0<em>A Call to Duty</em>:</strong><br>\n\u201cThis exciting book marks the first collaboration of two powerhouses . . . fans of both writers should be quite pleased with the result.

A shadowy enemy with the resources to hurl warships across hundreds of light years seeks to conquer the Star Kingdom for reasons unknown, while forces from within Manticore\u2019s own government seek to discredit and weaken the Navy for reasons very much known: their own political gain.  </p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to officers like Travis Long and Lisa Donnelly to defend the Star Kingdom and the Royal Manticoran Navy from these threats, but the challenge is greater than any they have faced before. Weakened but not defeated, the mercenary forces and their mysterious employer could return at any time, and the anti-Navy faction within Parliament is growing. The situation becomes even more dire when fresh tragedy strikes the Star Kingdom.  </p>\n<p>While the House of Winton faces their enemies at home, Travis, Lisa, and the other officers of the Royal Manticoran Navy must reunite with old friends and join new allies to hunt down and eliminate the forces arrayed against them in a galaxy-spanning conspiracy.  </p>\n<p>Manticore has learned that the universe is not a safe place, but the Star Kingdom\u2019s enemies are about to learn it's dangerous to mess with the Manticore!  </p>\n<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).  </p>\n<p>With over eight million copies of his books in print and thirty titles on the New York Times bestseller list, David Weber is the science fiction publishing phenomenon of the new millennium.

The graduating class from Saganami Island, the Royal Manticoran Navy's academy, are going straight from the classroom to the blazing reality of all-out war.  </p>\n<p>Except for the midshipmen assigned to the heavy cruiser HMS Hexapuma, that is. They're being assigned to the Talbott Cluster, an out of the way backwater, far from the battle front. The most they can look forward to is the capture of the occasional pirate cruiser and the boring duty of supporting the Cluster's peaceful integration with the Star Kingdom at the freely expressed will of eighty percent of the Cluster's citizens. With a captain who may have seen too much of war and a station commander who isn't precisely noted for his brilliant and insightful command style, it isn't exactly what the students of Honor Harrington, the \"Salamander,\" expected.  </p>\n<p>But things aren't as simple \u2014 or tranquil \u2014 as they appear. The \"pirates\" they encounter aren't what they seem, and the \"peaceful integration\" they expected turns into something very different. A powerful alliance of corrupt Solarian League bureaucrats and ruthless interstellar corporations is determined to prevent the Cluster's annexation by the Star Kingdom . . . by any means necessary. Pirates, terrorists, genetic slavers, smuggled weapons, long-standing personal hatreds, and a vicious alliance of corporate greed, bureaucratic arrogance, and a corrupt local star nation with a powerful fleet, are all coming together, and only Hexapuma, her war-weary captain, and Honor Harrington's students stand in the path.  </p>\n<p>They have only one thing to support and guide them: the tradition of Saganami. The tradition that sometimes a Queen's officer's duty is to face impossible odds . . . and die fighting.  </p>\n<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).  </p>\n<p>Undeniably the science fiction phenomenon of the decade, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author <strong>David Weber</strong> is often compared to C.S. Forester (the celebrated creator of Captain Horatio Hornblower) and is the recipient of critical praise worthy of Heinlein or Asimov. His hordes of voracious fans clamor for more and more Weber. Fortunately for them, Weber keeps steadily producing book after book with first printings that sell out almost immediately, then go back into printing after printing after printing. His novels range from epic fantasy ( <em>Oath of Swords</em> , <em>The War God's Own</em> , <em>Wind Rider's Oath</em> ) to breathtaking space opera ( <em>Path of the Fury</em> , <em>Empire from the Ashes</em> ) to military science fiction with in-depth characterization (the celebrated and nationally best-selling Honor Harrington series, <em>War of Honor</em> being the most recent installment). Reviewers call Weber \"irresistible . . . masterful\" ( <em>Publishers Weekly</em> ), \"highly entertaining\" ( <em>Booklist</em> ), \"remarkable\" ( <em>Kliatt</em> ), \"the best\" ( <em>Dragon</em> ), \"worth shouting about\" ( <em>Philadelphia Weekly Press</em> ), \"great . . . compelling\" ( <em>Locus</em> ), and \"the best writer around today\" ( <em>FosFax</em> ). Readers call Weber similar things, but mostly they call the Baen offices several times a week demanding more from their main man. Weber, his wife Sharon, and their three children live in South Carolina.\n**</p>",

Young teen Stephanie Harrington forms a telepathic bond with an intelligent alien treecat on a pioneer planet\u2014and must fight for the freedom of her new friend and his species against highly-placed enemies determined to claim the world for humans only. Stephanie Harrington always expected to be a forest ranger on her homeworld of Meyerdahl . . . until her parents relocated to the frontier planet of Sphinx in the far distant Star Kingdom of Manticore. It should have been the perfect new home --- a virgin wilderness full of new species of every sort, just waiting to be discovered. But Sphinx is a far more dangerous place than ultra-civilized Meyerdahl, and Stephanie\u2019s explorations come to a sudden halt when her parents lay down the law: no trips into the bush without adult supervision!  Yet Stephanie is a young woman determined to make discoveries, and the biggest one of all awaits her: an intelligent alien species.  The forest-dwelling treecats are small, cute, smart, and have a pronounced taste for celery. And they are also very, very deadly when they or their friends are threatened . . . as Stephanie discovers when she comes face-to-face with Sphinx\u2019s most lethal predator after a hang-gliding accident.   But her discoveries are only beginning, for the treecats are also telepathic and able to bond with certain humans, and Stephanie\u2019s find --- and her first-of-its kind bond with the treecat Climbs Quickly --- land both of them in a fresh torrent of danger. Galactic-sized wealth is at stake, and Stephanie and the treecats are squarely in the path of highly-placed enemies determined to make sure the planet Sphinx remains entirely in human hands, even if that means the extermination of another thinking species.  Unfortunately for those enemies, the treecats have saved Stephanie Harrington\u2019s life. She owes them . . . and Stephanie is a young woman who stands by her friends.  Which means things are about to get very interesting on Sphinx.About A Beautiful Friendship: \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find teen science fiction that strays beyond popular dystopian fare.
