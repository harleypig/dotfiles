            Imapsync tips about imap admin authentication.
=======================================================================

It can be useful to authenticate without knowing each user password.

Using an admin account to authenticate is not a standard feature
supported by all imap servers. Sometimes it is implemented via the 
--authuser1 option, sometimes not. It depends on the imap software
server and its configuration.

You have to follow this road:
 * Determine what is the imap software server
 * Find out whether it supports an admin account or not
 * If no, leave this reading, take an handkerchief and cry
 * If yes, search how the imap software server supports 
   an admin account (see below)
 * Figure out whether an admin account is actually configured or not,
 * If not then configure it. If you can't configure it: handkerchief.
 * Finally, check an imapsync authentication via this admin account for
   a standard user, the option --justlogin is nice for doing this.
 * Use it for all users.
 * Next, read their email messages, enter their personal life etc.
   I'm kidding.

Good luck!
