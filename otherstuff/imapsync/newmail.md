# Switching from Gmail to MXroute

Keeping a Google Workspace account for $130/month for five email accounts,
especially when no one is using any of the available apps, is prohibitive. So,
I'm canceling that account and switching to a provider that just supports email
for $45/year.

You have several optsion to choose from.

* You can make a clean break and get your own email (from Gmail, Hotmail, or
  whomever).

* You can go the above

You can use a different provider, such as stay with Gmail, but you won't be able to take your email address with you. 

# Web Interfaces

I don't have any of the backend stuff for these setup. Any additional apps
(calendar, contacts, etc.) are part of the app and are not supported by the
provider. They also are not migrated between interfaces, so if you've setup a
calendar on Roundcube and switch to SquirrelMail, none of the events in the
calendar will be migrated.

* Mattermost (it's a teams service)
* Roundcube
* Rainloop
* SquirrelMail

# Don't use

* Nextcloud (it's groupware)
* Office (it's groupware)
* Horde (it's groupware)
  NOTE: You **can** use this, but none of the other functionality is supported
  and may disappear at any moment ... the provider is in the process of trimming
  it down.
