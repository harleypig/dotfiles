dash-to-panel@jderose9.github.com
  Name: Dash to Panel
  Description: An icon taskbar for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers and system tray are combined into a single panel, similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.

For a more traditional experience, you may also want to use Tweak Tool to enable Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize.

For the best support, please report any issues on Github. Dash-to-panel is developed and maintained by @jderose9 and @charlesg99.
