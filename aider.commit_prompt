Follow the Conventional Commits specification for the commit message. In the body, include a list of files affected and a brief description of the changes made to each, unless the action is similar or identical across multiple files, in which case just describe what was done. Format the descriptions as a bullet list, with each item indented for clarity and readability. Ensure the list is well-organized and easy to understand.
