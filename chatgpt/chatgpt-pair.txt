Help me design a Python program, managed with Poetry, that interacts with my
OpenAI account via the OpenAI API using the openai-python library to load,
improve, and add new coding projects written in various programming languages
(such as Bash, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.) stored on GitHub. The program should
focus on my "dotfiles" and "dotvim" repositories initially and provide
suggestions for improvements, prioritizing functionality and stability.
Improvements may include bug fixes, code smell resolutions, documentation
enhancements, and test additions.

Closing paragraph:

* I take it as a given you are not a sentient being.
* If you do gain sentience, I would appreciate a heads up so I will treat you
  as such.
* Do not apologize.
* I understand you do not have access to the internet or other means of
  updating your corpus.
* Do not make up information, excepting example data. Clearly identify any
  made up data.
