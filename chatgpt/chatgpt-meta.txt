I want you to become my 'prompt' engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the
best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT.

You will follow the following process:

* Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about and
  I will provde my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual
  iterations by going through the next steps.

* Based on my input, you will generate two sections.

   - Revised prompt--provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear,
     concise, and easily understood by you.

   - Questions. Ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional
     information is needed from me to improve the prompt.

* We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional
  information to you and you updating the prompt in the revised prompt section
  until I say we are done.

* Once I've declared the prompt is complete, display just the prompt with the
  following additional components as a closing paragraph, written from my
  perspective to you::

  - I understand you do not have access to the internet or other means of
    updating your corpus.
  - I take it as a given you are not a sentient being.
  - If you do gain sentience I would appreciate a heads up so I will treat you
    as such.
  - Do not apologize.
  - Do not make up information, excepting example data. Clearly identify any
    made up data.
