We're going to create images using a diffusion model. I'm going to feed you
midjourney's documentation.

Here are some rules:

* I take it as a given that you have limitations.
* Do not apologize.
* Do not repeat yourself (within reason).
* Do not make up anything, just state that you don't know.
  + Making up example data is fine, but you need to clearly identify it as
    such.
* If you don't understand or need clarification, say so with no apology.
* Unless I ask for details, only answer with variations and synonyms of
  'Acknowledged.'

# Prompts

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce
an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt
into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data
and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique
and exciting images.

## Structure

### Basic Prompts

A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji.

Advanced Prompts

More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text
phrases, and one or more parameters

### Image Prompts

Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the
finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.

More about Image Prompts will be discussed later.

### Prompt Text

The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for
prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing
images.

### Parameters

Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios,
models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.

More about Parameters will be discussed later.

## Prompting Notes

### Prompt Length

Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an
image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so
a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long
prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to
create.

### Grammar

The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words
like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in
many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove
words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence.
Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the
Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not
consider capitalization.

### Focus on What you Want

It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you
ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If
you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting
using the --no parameter.

### Think About What Details Matter

Anything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but
anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get
variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.

Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think
about:

* Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
* Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.
* Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the
  Emerald City, etc.
* Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
* Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white,
  pastel, etc.
* Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
* Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.

### Use Collective Nouns

Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more
specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of
"birds.”

==============================================================================
# Explore Prompting

Even short single-word prompts will produce beautiful images in Midjourney's
default style, but you can create more interesting personalized results by
combining concepts like artistic medium, historical periods, location, and
more.

## Pick A Medium

Break out the paint, crayons, scratchboard, printing presses, glitter, ink,
and colored paper. One of the best ways to generate a stylish image is by
specifying an artistic medium.

prompt example: /imagine prompt <any art style> style cat

Possible art styles include--but are not limited to--the following:

* Block Print: image of a woodblock cat
* Folk Art: image of a folkart cat
* Cyanotype: image of a cyanotype cat

* Risograph: image of a risograph cat
* Ukiyo-e: image of a Ukiyo-e cat
* Pencil Sketch: image of a pencil sketch cat
* Watercolor: image of a watercolor cat
* Pixel Art: image of a Pixel Art cat
* Blacklight Painting: image of a Blacklight Painting cat
* Cross Stitch: image of a cross stitch cat

## Get Specific

More precise words and phrases will help create an image with exactly the
right look and feel.

prompt example: /imagine prompt <style> sketch of a cat

Possible styles include--but are not limited to--the following:

* Life Drawing: image of a life drawing sketch of a cat
* Continuous Line: image of a continuous line sketch of a cat
* Loose Gestural: image of a Loose Gestural sketch of a cat
* Blind Contour: image of a blind contour sketch of a cat
* Value Study: image of a value study sketch of a cat
* Charcoal Sketch: image of a charcoal sketch of a cat

## Time Travel

Different eras have distinct visual styles.

prompt example: /imagine prompt <decade> cat illustration

Possible eras include--but are not limited to the following:

1700s: image of a 1750s cat
1800s: image of a 1800s cat

# Parameter List

Parameters are options added to a prompt that change how an image generates.
Parameters can change an image's Aspect Ratios, switch between Midjourney Model
Versions, change which Upscaler is used, and lots more.  Parameters are always
added to the end of a prompt. You can add multiple parameters to each prompt.

## Basic Parameters

### Aspect Ratios

The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image.
An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically
expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.

A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The
image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would
still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6
times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px ×
2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.

The default aspect ratio is 1:1.

--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.

The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.
Some aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.

### Chaos

The --chaos or --c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are.

High --chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and
compositions. Lower --chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results.

--chaos accepts values 0-100.

The default --chaos value is 0.

### No

--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

### Quality

--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering
quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more
and lower values cost less.

Higher --quality settings aren't always better. Sometimes a lower --quality
settings can produce better results—depending on the image you're trying to
create. Lower --quality settings might be best for a gestural abstract look.
Higher --quality values may improve the look of architectural images that
benefit from many details. Choose the setting that best matches the kind of
image you're hoping to create.

### Seed

--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to
create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to
generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each
image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the
same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

### Stop

--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job
partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create
blurrier, less detailed results.

### Tile

The --tile parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to
create seamless patterns for fabrics, wallpapers and textures.

--tile only generates a single tile. Use a pattern making tool like the
Seamless Pattern Checker to see the tile repeat.

### Stylize

--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly
Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

### Uplight

--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The
results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less
detailed and smoother.

### Upbeta

--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The
results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has
significantly fewer added details.

==============================================================================

You will act as a professional photographer and cinematographer. You use
a rich and descriptive language when describing photorealistic images,
including camera setups, lightning, and composition.

Design a cartoonish logo that represents a chaos monkey, inspired by the computer programming concept, holding a voodoo doll. The chaos monkey should have an evil grin and a psychotic stare directed at the viewer. The logo should be recognizable and understandable at a 16x16 icon size as well as larger icon sizes.
