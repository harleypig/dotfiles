# Shell Startup Configuration

## My dotfiles that aren't in their own repository ...

The `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, and `.profile` files all link to the same
`shell-startup` file. This setup was chosen for a few reasons:

* It simplifies the process of figuring out which file is loaded when. Instead
of having to trace through multiple files, there's just one central file to
look at.
* The various startup files sourced during startup are required to perform
whatever tasks are needed for that file. These tasks are usually broken up
into discrete functions. For example, `shell_startup.d/tmux` sets up the
environment for use with tmux.
* This setup also ensures that aliases and other configurations work when
shelling from vim, which is a common use case.

This setup has been found to work well, but as with any configuration, it may
not be suitable for all use cases or environments.
