As this auspicious day began the race
Of ev'ry virtue join'd with ev'ry grace;
May you, who own them, welcome its return,
Till excellence, like yours, again is born.
The years we wish, will half your charms impair;
The years we wish, the better half will spare;
The victims of your eyes will bleed no more,
But all the beauties of your mind adore.
  -- Jeffrey, Miscellanies, To a Lady on her Birthday.

Believing hear, what you deserve to hear:
Your birthday as my own to me is dear.
Blest and distinguished days! which we should prize
The first, the kindest bounty of the skies.
But yours gives most; for mine did only lend
Me to the world; yours gave to me a friend.
  -- Martial, Epigrams (c. 80-104 AD), Book IX, Epistle 53.

That word had in my youthful ears;
And how each time the day comes round,

The land of the living was not far removed from the domain of the ancestors.
There was coming and going between them, especially at festivals and also when
an old man died, because an old man was very close to the ancestors. A man's
life from birth to death was a series of transition rites which brought him
nearer and nearer to his ancestors.

Gross well says that children are young because they play, and not vice versa;
and he might have added, 'men grow old because they stop playing, and not
conversely', for play is, at bottom, growth, and at the top of the intellectual
scale it is the eternal type of research from sheer love of truth.

We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.
