### Creating a RAG-based Vertex AI Model

This document will be shared with both volunteers for the hackathon team will
need an idea of what needs to be done and to management who don't need a lot
of detail.

No company data or code can be used in the sandbox environment, so we'll need
to use an open source project--preferably one that we currently use--as an
example for the RAG data. Once we've moved to the production environment
(where dev, test and stage environments will live) we can add necessary code
and documentation into a separate RAG model.

### What is needed?

I need to create a document with two sections. The first section should give an
overview of what needs to be done in creating a RAG based Vertex AI model,
with some possible ways it could be done.

The second section should be an overview of how to create a teams chatbot that
uses the RAG model created in the previous section. We need to include the
steps to prepare (how do we connect a bot to teams?) and we need to highlight
the idea that a bot would listen on a single, or if needed, multiple defined
channels. This bot would not be listening to all of our company teams
channels.
To develop a RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) based Vertex AI model, we will begin by selecting an open-source project that aligns with our current technology stack. This project will serve as a foundation for our model, ensuring that no proprietary data or code is utilized in the sandbox environment. The initial phase involves data preparation, where we will curate and sanitize datasets to train the model effectively. Following this, we will construct the model architecture, focusing on integrating a retriever to fetch relevant information and a generator to produce the desired output. The model will be trained iteratively, with evaluations to fine-tune its performance. Upon successful sandbox testing, we will document the process and prepare for migration to the production environment, where we can incorporate company-specific data and code.
