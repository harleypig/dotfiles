# Powershell Setup and Configuration

This was developed using Powershell 7+.

## First Steps

I am assuming `git` and `powershell 7+` have been installed and that the
repositories (currently dotfiles, dotvim, and private_dotfiles) have been cloned
in the appropriate locations.

* Set the profile for powershell using the `ps-profile.ps1` script. Use
  `ps-profile -h` for details.

## Best Practices After Initial Setup

1. **Update PowerShell Modules**: Regularly update your PowerShell modules to
ensure you have the latest features and security patches. Use `Update-Module`
for this purpose.

# Give an example for updating all modules and scripts, please. AI!

2. **Configure Execution Policy**: Set the execution policy to a level that balances security and functionality. For most users, `RemoteSigned` is a good choice. Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.

3. **Install Useful Modules**: Consider installing modules like `PSReadLine` for enhanced command-line editing, `Pester` for testing, and `PowerShellGet` for easy module management.

4. **Customize Your Profile**: Add frequently used functions, aliases, and environment variables to your PowerShell profile. This can greatly enhance your productivity.

5. **Enable Transcription**: For auditing and logging purposes, enable transcription using `Start-Transcript` to keep a record of your PowerShell sessions.

6. **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up your PowerShell profile and scripts to prevent data loss.

7. **Security Practices**: Regularly review and update your security settings, including permissions and access controls for scripts and modules.

8. **Learn and Explore**: Continuously learn new PowerShell features and best practices to improve your scripting skills.
