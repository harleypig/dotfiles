# Powershell Setup and Configuration

This was developed using Powershell 7+.

## First Steps

I am assuming `git` and `powershell 7+` have been installed and that the
repositories (currently dotfiles, dotvim, and private_dotfiles) have been cloned
in the appropriate locations.

* Set the profile for powershell using the `ps-profile.ps1` script. use
  `ps-profile -h` for details.
