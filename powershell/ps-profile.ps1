.SYNOPSIS
    This script checks if the PowerShell profile file ($PROFILE) exists. If the profile exists, the script exits with a message and suggests what to add if necessary. If the profile does not exist, it creates a new profile file that sources the `ps1-startup.ps1` file located in the directory where the script is run.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script is designed to simplify the setup of a PowerShell profile that includes custom startup configurations. The `ps1-startup.ps1` file in the current directory will be sourced in the profile file.

    HOW TO RUN
    Save this script as `setup-profile.ps1` and run it in PowerShell: ./setup-profile.ps1

    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create files in the profile's directory.

.NOTES
    - Requires PowerShell 5.1 or higher. - On Linux/macOS, make the script executable using `chmod +x`.
