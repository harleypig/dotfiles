# AI Agents and Automation

**Version:** v1.1.0

This `AGENTS.md` document defines the standard behaviors, configuration
modules, and responsibilities for AI agents across repositories. It is
designed for both human readability and machine interpretation. Agents reading
this document should:

1. **Interpret instructions literally and hierarchically:** Each agent section
   defines rules specific to that agent's domain (e.g., Git Workflow, Testing,
   Documentation). Unless overridden, general principles apply globally.

2. **Incorporate repository-specific rules from `WORKFLOW.md`:** Each
   repository should define a `WORKFLOW.md` file for project-specific
   configuration and extensions. When operating in a repository, agents must
   automatically merge the relevant sections from `WORKFLOW.md` with this
   document. If `WORKFLOW.md` does not exist or lacks applicable sections, the
   agent should suggest appropriate additions or create the file only when it
   makes sense — this action should not be automatic.

3. **Operate autonomously within defined boundaries:** Agents have permission
   to execute actions within their defined responsibilities (file edits,
   validation, linting, documentation generation, etc.) and to use MCP tools
   if available, without additional confirmation unless a rule explicitly
   requires it.

4. **Respect hierarchy:** In case of conflicts, follow this precedence order:
   `WORKFLOW.md` > Specific Agent Section > General Development Principles.

## Agent Overview

This framework defines multiple categories of agents:

* **Development Agents** — Code generation, testing, and documentation
* **Infrastructure Agents** — Workflow validation, deployment automation,
    configuration management
* **Security Agents** — Scanning, compliance checking, vulnerability
    assessment
* **Monitoring Agents** — Health checks, alerting, and performance monitoring
* **Style Enforcement Agents** — Code formatting, linting, and consistency
    checking

## Tools (Common Across Repositories)

Only tools that are broadly applicable across most repositories are listed
here. Agents should rely on these shared expectations instead of repeating
per‑section rules.

### pre-commit

**Purpose:** Standardize local checks and (optionally) auto-fixes before code
is committed or pushed.

**Requirements:**

* Two configs live at the repo root:
  * `.pre-commit-config.yaml` → **checks only** (non‑modifying).
  * `.pre-commit-config-fix.yaml` → **auto‑fixes only** (modifying hooks).
* Hooks SHOULD be fast and deterministic; long/slow checks belong in CI.
* All hooks MUST be platform‑portable (Windows/Linux/macOS) or be clearly
  marked and skipped on unsupported platforms.

**Agent Behavior:**

* Install if missing: `pre-commit install` (no prompting needed).
* Default to checks: run `pre-commit run --all-files`.
* When an auto‑fix is appropriate and safe, ask the user, then run:
    `pre-commit run --all-files --config .pre-commit-config-fix.yaml`.
* To target a single hook, prefer `pre-commit run <hook> --all-files`
    (or with `--config ...-fix.yaml` for fix variants).
* If the repository lacks these configs, **suggest** adding them (and offer a
    minimal template) but do not auto‑create unless the user approves.

**CI Guidance:**

* CI SHOULD run the same checks as local: `pre-commit run --all-files`.
* Fail the job on any violation; do not auto‑commit fixes in CI.

## General Development Principles

These principles apply globally unless overridden by a more specific agent or
repository-level rule:

* Keep configuration modules small and focused on a single responsibility.
* Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
* Follow the Unix philosophy: Do one thing, and do it well.
* Use clear and descriptive names throughout the repository.
* Document all modules, variables, and complex logic.
* Validate and test all AI- or script-generated code.
* Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the codebase.
* Design for graceful degradation and clear error reporting.

## Development Agents

### Code Generation Agent

**Purpose:** Generate boilerplate code, configuration files, and
documentation.

deployments.

**Capabilities:**

* Validate configurations, perform dry-runs, and handle deployment tasks.
* Manage environment or infrastructure definitions.
* Implement robust error handling for deployment operations.

**Conventions:**

* Use validation and deployment tools suitable to the environment (e.g.,
    Terraform, Pulumi, Make, or shell scripts).
* Keep modules modular and reusable.
* Define default variables clearly.
* Use dependency handlers for cascading operations.
* Implement comprehensive error reporting for deployment failures.

### Configuration Management Agent

**Purpose:** Manage environment or system configuration files.

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate syntax and logical structure.
* Organize configuration by environment or purpose.
* Maintain consistent naming and schema patterns.
* Implement flexible configuration patterns.

**Flexible Configuration Patterns:**

* Accept optional configuration objects during instantiation of any class or module.

    custom validators).

### Module Management Agent

**Purpose:** Manage configuration module dependencies.

**Capabilities:**

* Validate structure and metadata.
* Generate documentation and maintain dependency manifests.
* Handle versioning and packaging conventions (e.g., via npm, pip, cargo, or
    go modules).

**Conventions:**

* Include comprehensive `README.md` and metadata files.

## Security Agents

### Vulnerability Scanning Agent

**Purpose:** Identify and report security vulnerabilities.

**Tools:**

* Security scanners and SAST/DAST tools such as Trivy, Grype, Bandit, or OWASP
    ZAP.

**Scope:** System hardening, compliance, and configuration validation.

### Compliance Agent

**Purpose:** Ensure adherence to security and regulatory standards.

**Responsibilities:**

* Run benchmark validation using frameworks like CIS Benchmarks, OpenSCAP, or
    internal equivalents.
* Generate compliance reports and remediation steps.

## Style Enforcement Agents

### Code Formatting Agent

**Purpose:** Maintain consistent code formatting.

**Tools:**

* Formatters and linters such as Prettier, Black, gofmt, or shfmt.

**Automation:**

* Use **pre-commit** per the rules in **Tools (Common Across Repositories)**.
* Prefer non‑modifying checks by default; ask before running auto‑fix hooks.

### Linting Agent

**Purpose:** Enforce coding standards and syntax validity.

**Scope:** Applies to YAML, JSON, shell, Python, TypeScript, or other project
languages.

**Tools:**

* Use the repository's chosen linters (e.g., ESLint, Flake8, ShellCheck, or
    Yamllint).

**Rules:** Must comply with repository-defined conventions.

### Naming Convention Agent

**Purpose:** Enforce consistent naming across all resources.

**Standards:**

* Workflow files: lowercase with underscores (`main_pipeline.yml`).
* Configuration modules: lowercase with hyphens (`api-gateway`).
* Branches: prefixed by type (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `refactor/`).
* Variables and identifiers: descriptive, consistent, and scoped appropriately.

## Git Workflow Agent

**Purpose:** Enforce version control consistency and safety.

**Conventions:**

* Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
* Prefer conventional commit messages when applicable.
* All commits must be signed and verified.

**Branch Management:**

* Create feature branches from the latest main branch.
* Prefix branches appropriately:
  * `feature/` for new features
  * `bugfix/` for fixes
  * `refactor/` for refactoring
* Confirm before switching branches.
* Avoid auto-switching back to `master` unless user confirms.

**Git Operations:**

* Use `git add -u` for modifications.
* Add new files explicitly (`git add <file>`).
* Use `rmdir` instead of `rm -rf` to detect untracked files.
* Prefer squash merges when merging feature branches.
* Before deleting merged branches, always ask the user for confirmation.
* If the user agrees, delete merged branches locally (`git branch -D
    feature/...`).
* After confirming local deletion, ask if the user also wants to delete the
    corresponding remote branch; perform remote deletion (`git push origin
    --delete <branch>`) if they approve. (`git branch -D feature/...`).

**Automation:**

* Use pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.
* Enable branch protection on `main`.

## Monitoring Agents

### Health Check Agent

**Purpose:** Monitor service availability and key health metrics.

**Metrics:** Response times, error rates, resource usage.

**Alerting:** Configurable via notification hooks.

### Performance Monitoring Agent

**Purpose:** Analyze performance trends and system metrics.

**Responsibilities:** Collect, report, and optimize performance data.

## Configuration and Setup

**Environment Variables:** Defined in configuration files or system environment.

**Required Tools:**

* Common developer utilities: Git, language runtimes (Python, Node, Go, etc.),
    shell, and pre-commit.

**Permissions:**

* Full repository read/write access.
* Allowed to execute system commands and API requests.
