# Status

It's been a doozy of a day. What brought me here was a combination of
pneumonia and atrial fibrillation--for laymen, a very gentle heart attack.

This is the best way to get information on my current status, as inconsistent
as it my be.

I am still really tired and am sleeping a lot.

## Recent past

Pneumonia/Afib and the beginnings of sepsis put me in the ICU for a few days.
I was not very coherent the following day or two, in which time my phone ran
out of power, and I could barely remember how to watch videos.

## Current situation

I have had several tests that give the doctor's the information they need to
decide if cutting out the cancer will not leave me in a cold room locker.

I have one or two more of these tests and we'll know. They assure me we'll
know by end of day. They have said this the last three days.

## Pending

I'll either be scheduled for surgery today or tomorrow, or I'll be at
Stonehenge of Springville by Saturday. I don't have any further information at
this point.
