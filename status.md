# Status

[Link to this page](https://harleypig.github.io/dotfiles/status)

It's been a doozy of a day. What brought me here was a combination of
pneumonia and atrial fibrillation--for laymen, a very gentle heart attack.

This is the best way to get information on my current status, as inconsistent
as it my be.

I am still really tired and am sleeping a lot.

## Recent past

Pneumonia/Afib and the beginnings of sepsis put me in the ICU for a few days.
I was not very coherent the following day or two, in which time my phone ran
out of power, and I could barely remember how to watch videos.

## Current situation

I have had several tests that give the doctor's the information they need to
decide if cutting out the cancer will not leave me in a cold room locker.

I have one or two more of these tests and we'll know. They assure me we'll
know by end of day. They have said this the last three days.

## Pending

I'll either be scheduled for surgery today or tomorrow, or I'll be at
Stonehenge of Springville by Saturday. I don't have any further information at
this point.

## Updates

### 02-05-26

I'm scheduled to go in to surgery tomorrow sometime (tbd) but there is still
some question, so I won't know for sure until the last moment.

### 02-06-26

Yay. I passed all my tests. Wahoo. The surgery is tentaively this morning.

* Post Surgery

I'm fine. Surgery went well. Typing with left hand only sucks. Need to sleep.

### 02-07-26

I started to write this morning, but got sidelined by tests and followups,
then needed a nap.

The surgery removed a lump and two lymph nodes from my right chest and armpit.

I am awake and coherent (as coherent as I ever am). I have been moved to
a non-ICU room and they think they will transfer me to a long term care
facility in Springville tomorrow or the next day.

### 02-08-26

Sorry ... I keep sleeping and fuzzing out.

I'm much more coherent today. For relative values of coherent. No update info
for my next steps.

### 02-09-26

I've been waiting to find out what my status is in regards to going home or to
a long term care facility. Unfortunately, it's still "maybe today, maybe
a couple of days" :| So I continue to languish in limbo.
