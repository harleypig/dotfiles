# Aider and AI Coding Conventions

This document outlines coding conventions for projects using Aider and AI,
inspired by Pragmatic Programming principles.

- Security: Consider security implications and implement best practices to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.

- DRY: Avoid duplication; use functions/modules.
- KISS: Code should be simple, clear, and easy to understand.
- YAGNI: Implement features only when needed.
- SOLID: Follow SOLID design principles.

- Naming: Use clear, consistent names. Names should show intent.
- Functions: Should be small and do one thing well.
- Modularity: Write small, reusable modules.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling. Where possible, use exceptions.

- Comments: Only when necessary. Explain complex logic; avoid obvious comments. Keep comments current.
- README/DOCS: Keep setup/use instructions current.
- API Docs: Document public APIs clearly.

- Automated Tests: Ensure reliability with tests.
- Coverage: Aim for meaningful test coverage.
- CI: Use CI tools for automatic testing.

- Commits: Write clear, imperative commit messages, following the Conventional Commits specification.
- Branching: Use a consistent branching strategy.
