# Coding Conventions

This document outlines the coding conventions based on the principles of
Pragmatic Programming. These conventions are designed to improve code
readability, maintainability, and collaboration within the team.

## General Principles

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality into functions or modules.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Write simple and straightforward code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Implement features only when they are needed, not when they are anticipated.
- SOLID Principles: Follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to create robust and maintainable code.

## Code Structure

- Consistent Naming: Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Modular Design: Break down code into small, reusable modules or functions.
- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and maintenance.

## Documentation

- Comments: Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks. Avoid obvious comments.
- README: Maintain an up-to-date README file with instructions on how to set up and use the project.
- API Documentation: Provide clear documentation for public APIs, including input parameters, return values, and examples.

## Testing

- Automated Tests: Write automated tests for critical code paths to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- Test Coverage: Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over achieving 100% coverage.
- Continuous Integration: Use continuous integration tools to run tests automatically on code changes.

## Version Control

- Commit Messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use the imperative mood and include the purpose of the change.
- Branching Strategy: Follow a consistent branching strategy, such as Git Flow or GitHub Flow, to manage feature development and releases.

By adhering to these conventions, we can ensure a high standard of code quality and facilitate effective collaboration within the team.
