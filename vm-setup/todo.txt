Add task to set sudoers for a user:
  Defaults:your_username timestamp_timeout=60

get git-bug setup for this repo

figure out how to use ansible-vault so I don't have to keep typing my password

figure out how to use `dconf dump /`, `gsettings` and python to load dconf
settings, then load the schemas and find the default value and only dump the
settings that have been changed.

add playbook for setting user groups (on ubuntu modify /etc/adduser.conf) Use
`groups` command to see what you've got setup already. Is there a way to
modify this piecemeal, so if docker is not installed then it's not set?
