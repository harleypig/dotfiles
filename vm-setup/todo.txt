create and add a script to copy and cleanup my firefox profile so that it can
be installed via an ansible task

Questions:
  Can I name the profile what I want or does it have to be a hashed value like
  it is by default?

  How do I modify the profiles.ini file from ansible to make my new profile
  the default profile?

1. Clear Cache and Offline Data Manually in Firefox:

Before copying the profile, you can clear cache and offline website data
through Firefox's settings. This can significantly reduce the profile size.
From the Profile Folder: Look for and delete the Cache, OfflineCache, and
storage (especially storage/default containing site-specific offline data)
directories within the profile folder.

2. Remove Unnecessary Files Minidumps:

Delete the minidumps folder if present, which contains crash reports.

datareporting and healthreport Folders: These contain telemetry and health
reports which are not necessary for the profile to function on another
machine.

saved-telemetry-pings Folder: Contains telemetry data that can be removed.

3.  Compact Databases Firefox uses SQLite databases for storing various types
of data (like history and cookies).

These databases can be compacted to reduce their size.

Use SQLite Tools: Tools like sqlite3 can be used to compact databases. For
each .sqlite file in the profile directory, you can run: bash

  sqlite3 [database_file_name].sqlite "VACUUM;"

This command compacts the database by removing unused space.

4. Review and Remove Extensions

Extensions: If there are extensions that are not needed, consider removing
them from within Firefox before copying the profile. Extensions can add
significantly to the profile size through their own data storage.

5. Exclude Specific Files

places.sqlite (Bookmarks and History): If not needed, you can remove
places.sqlite, but be aware this removes all bookmarks and history.

sessionstore-backups Folder: Contains session backup files which can be large.
If you don't need to restore previous sessions, this can be safely removed.

6. Create a New Profile and Migrate Selected Data

If the profile is still larger than desired, consider creating a new profile
and manually migrating only the essential data (like bookmarks, which can be
exported and imported through Firefox's Library menu).

Automating Cleanup

For automating these tasks, especially if deploying profiles across multiple
machines, you might script the deletion of certain directories and files
within the profile before copying it. For example, a simple bash script could
delete cache directories and compact databases as part of your deployment
process.

Final Steps

After paring down the profile, ensure it still contains everything you need by
testing it on your local Firefox installation. Once confirmed, proceed with
copying the slimmed-down profile using your preferred method, like Ansible,
for deployment.
