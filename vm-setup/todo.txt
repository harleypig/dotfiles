Add task to set sudoers for a user:
  Defaults:your_username timestamp_timeout=60

get git-bug setup for this repo

figure out how to use ansible-vault so I don't have to keep typing my password

settings, then load the schemas and find the default value and only dump the
settings that have been changed.

add playbook for setting user groups (on ubuntu modify /etc/adduser.conf) Use
`groups` command to see what you've got setup already. Is there a way to
modify this piecemeal, so if docker is not installed then it's not set?

modify docker role to setup existing users and setup skel to allow new users

create a role to install repositories in projects directory

create a (separate?) role to setup dotfiles and dotvim and private_dotfiles

add molecule tests
