* Variable Definition Test: Verify that all required variables are defined for
  each repository.

* Repository Key Installation Test: Check if the repository public key is
  correctly installed on the system.

* Repository Addition Test: Ensure that the repository is correctly added to
  the system's package manager.

* Idempotence Test: Confirm that running the role/task again does not make any
  changes if the repository is already added.

* Error Handling Test: Test the role's ability to handle errors, such as
  attempting to add an undefined repository.

* Validation Test: Verify that the validation step correctly identifies
  undefined repositories and provides a meaningful error message.

* Platform Compatibility Test: Ensure that the role works across different
  distributions or versions if applicable.

* Security Test: Check that the key installation process is secure and that
  keys are obtained from a trusted source.

* Cleanup Test: If the role includes the ability to remove repositories, test
  that the removal process works correctly and cleans up any associated files.
