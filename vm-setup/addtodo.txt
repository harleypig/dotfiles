Investigate and integrate YAML and Ansible formatting tools to ensure consistent code style.

Ideas for implementation:
- CLI Tool:
  - Research and evaluate existing YAML and Ansible linting/formatters such as yamllint and ansible-lint.
  - Integrate these tools into a pre-commit hook to ensure code style consistency before commits are made.
  - Create a custom script that wraps around these tools to provide a unified interface for linting and formatting.

- Vim Configuration:
  - Utilize Vim plugins that support YAML and Ansible syntax highlighting and formatting, such as vim-ansible-yaml.
  - Configure Vim to automatically run yamllint and ansible-lint on save.
  - Set up Vim autocmd hooks to format YAML and Ansible files on buffer write or leave.
  - Explore the possibility of integrating ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) in Vim for real-time linting feedback.
