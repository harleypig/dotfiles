Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. I have these error "could not be fetched", like this one:
Err 1/1: - msg INBOX/17219 {0} S[36592] F[] I[16-Jul-2021 12:04:15 +0000] could not be fetched
What can I do about it?

Now the questions again with their answers.

R. Explanation of a log line:

- msg INBOX/17219 {0} S[36592] F[] I[16-Jul-2021 12:04:15 +0000]

INBOX    = folder
17219    = UID
{0}      = got 0 bytes 
S[36592] = should have got 36592 bytes (RFC size announced)
F[]      = Flags, none here
I[16-Jul-2021 12:04:15 +0000] = Internal date

Usually this error doesn't appear on next runs, at least not for the 
same messages. So rerun imapsync until all messages are synced.

If the same error persists on every run, try to sync the message with
another email tool like Thunderbird. Find the message from its size
and its flags and its internal date.
