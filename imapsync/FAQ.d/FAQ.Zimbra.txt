doing a standard sync without additional options.

Flagging
Users can create flags and assign them to messages, contacts, and files in Briefcase folders.
In the Admin Console, see COS -> Features -> Mail Features container

Is Flagging on on host2? 
If yes, see https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Flags.txt

=======================================================================
Q. Zimbra disconnects without reason
   Could not select: * BYE ... Zimbra IMAP4rev1 server closing connection

A. The cause of this problem may be that some users have a subscription 
   of a shared folder from a mailbox locked and so the shared folder.
   The access problems may happen in a lot of folders, 
   not only the shared/locked one.

   It should work after removing the locked/shared folder.

   Thanks to Danny Herrlitz for this input!

=======================================================================
Q. Imapsync finds 0 folders on a Zimbra account.

A. Check there are no broken mountpoints in the account you are trying 
   to sync. Broken mountpoints appear strike through in the webmail.

   Just remove the broken mountpoint (clicking on it in the webmail 
   will show a popup you just have to confirm) and Zimbra will stop 
   answering there's zero IMAP folder to the LIST "" *.
