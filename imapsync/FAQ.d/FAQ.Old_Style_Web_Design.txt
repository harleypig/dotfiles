              Imapsync and its ugly website style
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Q. Why does the imapsync website look so old-fashioned?

R. Once in a while, I receive messages from people complaining about 
the website style. It's not that much about the content though,
as people don't read.

I know the imapsync website has a grandmother style,
I'm not offended by complaints about it.

Here are several reasons it stays like that for now:

* I like to do things myself. I'm then less dependent on someone else or
  on some fancy new framework that won't last long.

* I like the static web.
  I like dynamic web when the dynamic brings something that
  can't be done easily with static files. I use Server Side Include, 
  aka SSI, denoted by the ".shtml" extension of some files,
  instead of the classical ".html" extension.
  

* I'm proud to be w3c-compliant. 
  Check the imapsync website w3c-compliance at
  https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fimapsync.lamiral.info
  Very few sites are w3c-compliant, it's because nearly all CMS frameworks 
  aren't. I don't use CMS frameworks.
  Only true crazy people are w3c-compliant seekers. I'm one of them.
  If you know a CMS w3c compliant, tell me, it will be such crazy news.
  If you know any website w3c-compliant, tell me, it will be crazy news as well.
  Update: https://contao.org/ is a CMS and it is w3c-compliant! This is astonishing!
  (Thanks to Markus Rupprecht for this crazy input!)
  
* I prefer to spend more time on the product itself than the showcase.
  That said, the showcase in its current form does take time, hours and
  hours to look bad.

* The product is a command line, a fancy website to sell a command line
  makes more disappointed buyers.

* I am lazy.

I agree I could do some sort of A/B experiment and see whether during
a month I sell more imapsync on a brand new style B site than
the current A one.


Besides, don't misunderstand buyers. The surprising thing about complainers
is that all are web designers, and none of them is a user not in the web design branch.

I even received a phone call from a buyer saying: "I saw your website 
and I told to myself: this can't be a fake one, the product must be a good one".

Another folk like me:

(well, not w3c-compliant, he is not that mad)

So maybe one day...
