=======================================================================
Q. My virus scanner claims imapsync.exe is a virus/malware/trojan etc.
   What the hell?

R1. Yes, I find the same report sometimes with few antivirus, 
   they report that imapsync might have a trojan in it.
   
   Most virus scanners say imapsync.exe is ok.
   
   I've done this test on imapsync.exe releases 
   2.229 2.178 1.977, 1.945 and 1.836 
   on the two following meta-virus-scanners
   https://www.virustotal.com/
   https://www.metadefender.com/

R2. Explanation of the trojan detection: 
    It may come from the fact that imapsync checks whether there is a
    new release available at http://imapsync.lamiral.info/VERSION
    It's explained here:
    https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#NUMBERS

    Any other explanation is welcome!

R3. There is no virus alerts reported for the Perl script imapsync
    itself. The binary imapsync.exe is just a compiled version of
    the script imapsync, with perl interpreter itself and all modules 
    needed by imapsync in order to make imapsync.exe a standalone software.

R4. Here are the reports using the online meta-virus-scanners
