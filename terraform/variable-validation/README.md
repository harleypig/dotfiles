# Variable Validation in Terraform

While a module (such as variable-validation/tfmod_file) will allow any valid value, we want to limit our filename so we need to use variable validation. This ensures that the values provided for variables meet specific criteria, enhancing the reliability and predictability of our Terraform configurations.

Variable validation in Terraform allows us to enforce rules on variable values. By using the `validation` block within a variable definition, we can specify conditions that the variable must meet. If the conditions are not met, Terraform will produce an error message, preventing the configuration from being applied with invalid values.
