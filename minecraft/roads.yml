  # Need to build this and make 3-5 levels
  # First level needs to be as simple as possible.
  # Last level needs tracks.
  # x should always be the width of the segment
  # z should always be the length of the segment
  # y needs to be revisited to make sure we catch any bugs
  # block should be the Decoration Controller

  # need:
  #   corner (3-5 levels)
  #   t-intersection (3-5 levels)
  #   4-way intersection (3-5 levels)
