# Assumptions:
#
#  - Block placement is based on front left corner (as you are facing the
#    block, not the front of the building, since they don't always match).
#  - Block placement 0 is ground level. Plus is up, minus is down.
#  - Townhall block would be 5 blocks in on the x-axis, 8 on the y-axis, and
#    1 block up.
#  - If style exists it can have two kinds of values.
#    - alt/standard (will use base_style)
#    - Style Name (alt)
#  - 'front' is facing, reverse, left, right
#    - 'facing' is facing you, even if the front of the building is behind
#      you.
#    - 'reverse' is in the direction you are facing the block
#    - 'left' and 'right' is to the left or right as you are facing the
#      block.
