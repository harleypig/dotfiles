# Agent config structure

A navigable reference for the Claude Code agent configuration in this
dotfiles repo. If you're new to this setup, start with *Design* below. If
you know what you're looking for, jump straight to the relevant table.

**This file is hand-maintained** — update it whenever a rule, skill, or
hook is added, modified, or removed. It is not auto-loaded into the agent
context; the trigger lives in `CLAUDE.md` *Missing or Conflicting Tool
Rules*.

## Design: generic to specific

The configuration is layered. The most generic rules sit at the top and
load every conversation; more specific rules load only when relevant files
are detected; skills package the multi-step procedures those rules
describe; hooks enforce the critical rules deterministically.

Each layer refers *upward* — a skill names the rule it implements, a
detection-activated rule extends the generic rule it specialises. This
means you can understand any piece by reading what it points to above it,
and you can find the right piece by starting at the generic layer and
drilling down.

```text
Always-on rules          ← invariant policy, every conversation
Detection-activated rules ← same policy, but scoped to a tool/language
Skills                   ← multi-step procedures those rules call for
Hooks                    ← deterministic enforcement of the must-nots
```

A rule describes *what* the policy is and *when* to reach for a skill or
command. A skill describes *how* to execute a multi-step procedure. A hook
*enforces* a rule mechanically, without relying on the model remembering.

---

## Always-on rules

Loaded into every conversation. These are the invariant layer — they
apply regardless of what files are in the repo.

The **Calls / see also** column lists skills the rule explicitly invokes or
names as its forcing function (`skill-name`), rules it cross-references
(`rule.md`), and built-in commands it names as a step (`/cmd`).

| Rule | What it governs | Calls / see also |

| [troubleshooting.md](rules/troubleshooting.md) | Reproduce first, fix the root cause, land a regression test | `debug-assistant` · `qa-check` |

---

## Detection-activated rules

These load automatically when you work with matching files. They extend
the always-on rules with tool- or language-specific policy. Each file's
`paths:` frontmatter names what triggers it. Where a rule has a companion
skill that provides deeper patterns or procedures, it is noted below the
rule name.

## Skills

Skills are multi-step procedures invoked on demand (by name or trigger
phrase). Each one is backed by a `SKILL.md` that defines the exact steps.
Locally authored skills live under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

The **Calls / see also** column shows skills the skill explicitly invokes
or composes (`skill-name`), rules it reads for policy (`rule.md`), hooks
it involves (`hook.py`), and built-in commands it names as a step (`/cmd`).

## Hooks

Hooks run automatically on specific events — they enforce rules
deterministically, without relying on the model remembering.

| Hook | Event | What it enforces |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| [branch-protection.py](hooks/branch-protection.py) | `PreToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` | Blocks file edits while a protected branch is checked out; derives the protected branch list from the `no-commit-to-branch` pre-commit args (`git.md`) |
| [merge-finalization.py](hooks/merge-finalization.py) | `PreToolUse` on `gh pr merge` / `ship.sh merge` | Blocks a merge while completed `- [x]` items remain in planning docs (opt-in per repo via `merge-finalization: enforce` in `WORKFLOW.md`) |
| [shell-check.py](hooks/shell-check.py) | `PostToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` | Runs `shellcheck` on a shell file immediately after it is edited, surfacing findings to the agent in-session |
| [iac-fmt.py](hooks/iac-fmt.py) | `PostToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` | Auto-formats an edited Terraform/Packer file (`terraform`/`packer fmt` via the bin/ docker wrappers), reports parse errors `fmt` can't fix, and runs a cheap validate (terraform only if `.terraform/` exists; packer `-syntax-only`); fails open (`terraform.md`/`packer.md`) |
| [md5-guard.py](hooks/md5-guard.py) | `PostToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` | Auto-regenerates a git-tracked `<name>.md5` checksum after the agent edits its file, so managed edits stay blessed and only out-of-band changes look like drift (dormant where no such sibling exists; powers the dotfiles `shell-startup-guard` skill) |
| [rule-coverage.py](hooks/rule-coverage.py) | `PostToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` | Nags when a new dependency or language has no matching `rules/<name>.md` |
| [compact-snapshot.py](hooks/compact-snapshot.py) | `SessionStart` with source `compact` | Re-injects a git/session-state snapshot after a `/compact`, restoring context the compaction would otherwise drop |
| [audit-cadence.py](hooks/audit-cadence.py) | `SessionStart` (startup / resume / clear) | Once-a-day nudge that a `claude-audit` pass is due |
