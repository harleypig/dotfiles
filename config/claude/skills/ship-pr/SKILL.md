description: Commit a finished feature branch, push it, open a pull request, watch CI to green, and (with explicit approval) merge it and clean up — using this user's gh credential fallback and the repo's branch-protection merge policy. Use whenever the user wants to land work via a PR: "ship this", "ship it", "land this branch", "commit push and PR", "open a PR and merge", "put up a PR", "get this merged", "create the PR and merge after CI", or any request to take a ready branch through the PR-and-merge sequence. Starts where git-worktree-workflow's "prep for PR" ends; works for plain feature branches too (no worktree required).

# Ship PR

**Version:** v1.1.0

Take a finished branch through the standard landing sequence: commit →
push → open PR → watch CI → (approval) merge → clean up.

The deterministic mechanics live in the bundled **`scripts/ship.sh`** (in
this skill's directory). The model owns the judgment: commit messages, PR
copy, CI-failure diagnosis, and the merge decision. This skill orchestrates
the existing rules rather than restating them:

- Credential fallback and PR conventions: `rules/gh.md`.
- CI monitoring: `rules/github-actions.md`.
- Default-branch derivation, force-push, post-merge prune: `rules/git.md`.
- Pre-commit fix→check ordering: `rules/pre-commit.md`.

## Prerequisites

- `git`, and `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- Work is functionally complete and locally verified (tests/lint pass).
- You are on a feature branch, not the default branch.

## Helper script

`scripts/ship.sh` wraps the judgment-free steps. Every gh call inside it
auto-retries with the env tokens cleared on a PAT scope error, so the
`rules/gh.md` fallback is handled for you.

| Subcommand | Does |
|------------|------|
| `default-branch` | Print the repo's default branch. |
| `pr-create --title T --body B [--base BR]` | Open the PR from the current branch; prints the URL. |
| `ci-watch [BRANCH]` | Poll the latest run to completion; print job results; exit non-zero if CI failed. |
| `merge-methods` | Print the merge methods the repo/ruleset allows. |
| `merge NUMBER --squash\|--merge\|--rebase` | Merge and delete the branch. |
| `cleanup BRANCH` | Switch to default, pull, prune the merged branch. |

## Guardrails (do not violate)

- **Never** open or merge a PR without the user's go-ahead. Invoking this
  skill is consent to commit/push/open the PR; **merging requires an
  explicit "merge" instruction** for this branch. If the user only said
  "open a PR", stop after CI and ask.
- **Never** push to or merge directly into the default branch.
- **Never** force-push without `--force-with-lease --force-if-includes`,
  and warn first.
- **Never** `--no-verify` or bypass required checks.
- Keep the `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` footer on AI-authored commits.

## Step 0 — Preconditions

```bash
DEF=$(ship.sh default-branch)
CUR=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If `CUR` equals `DEF`, stop: create a `feature/<name>` branch first (or
use the **git-worktree-workflow** skill), then resume.

## Step 1 — Commit (model authors)

If `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists, run the final prep sequence ONCE
(per `rules/pre-commit.md`): the fix config, then the check config.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --config .pre-commit-config-fix.yaml
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Stage and commit with a Conventional Commit message (subject < 72 chars,
imperative; body explains *why*). Group into logically-themed commits;
don't dump development noise. Keep the `Co-Authored-By` footer.

## Step 2 — Push

```bash
git push -u origin "$CUR"
```

## Step 3 — Open the PR (model writes the body)

Compose the title (< 72 chars) and a body per `rules/gh.md` (`## Summary`
+ `## Test plan`), then:

```bash
ship.sh pr-create --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

The script handles the PAT→OAuth fallback. Report the PR URL.

## Step 4 — Watch CI

```bash
ship.sh ci-watch "$CUR"
```

On failure (non-zero exit): fetch `gh run view <id> --log-failed`,
diagnose, and propose a fix before touching files — distinguish code
failures (fix the source) from infra failures (`gh run rerun --failed`).
Fix, push, re-watch until green. Report pass/fail. **Do not merge on red.**

## Step 5 — Merge (only with explicit approval)

Confirm the user asked to merge this branch. Discover the allowed methods
(rulesets often restrict to squash-only) and choose:

```bash
ship.sh merge-methods
```

| Situation                                   | Flag        |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Only `squash` allowed                       | `--squash`  |
| Single-theme PR, no restriction             | `--squash`  |
| Multi-theme PR worth preserving as commits  | `--merge`   |

```bash
ship.sh merge <number> --squash   # or --merge / --rebase
```

If the merge is rejected for *missing required checks* (not a scope
error), CI is not green or a required check name doesn't match a job
`name:`. Fix that; do not bypass.

## Step 6 — Post-merge cleanup

```bash
ship.sh cleanup "$CUR"
```

Report the merge commit and what landed.

## Notes

- After a merge, a CI workflow that publishes artifacts (images, packages,
  releases) on `push` to the default branch runs again — watch it with
  `ship.sh ci-watch <default-branch>` if the user cares about the publish.
- For upstream/fork PRs, target the upstream repo (`gh repo view --json
  parent`) and prefer rebase for upstream-bound branches (`rules/git.md`).
- Invoke `ship.sh` by its path in this skill's `scripts/` directory.
