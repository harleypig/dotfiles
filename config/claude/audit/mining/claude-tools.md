| deployment-engineer, cloud-architect, data-engineer, ml-engineer | stack | CANDIDATE | infra/data/ML — build when first used (ADR-0003) |
| payment-integration, graphql-architect | stack | CANDIDATE | domain-specific but high-value when relevant |
| python-pro, typescript-expert, golang-pro, rust-pro | stack | CANDIDATE | language-expert personas — low priority, rules already encode per-lang policy |
